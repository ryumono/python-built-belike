Just Python,
If you want some learning about python, come visit us
we will share some Code for Python

I will write comment/documentation in Indonesian Language
if you are not Indonesian, you can use Translator if you want

## First in Python
1. Install VS Code (website for VS Code): https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install some Extensions for Python Supports (in this example, i install Jupyter Notebook for purpose)
3. Don't forget to adjust Environment Path for Python (you can watch for tutorial)
4. Install Python Build in this Device (PC/Laptop) (Newer Version 3.13)

## Notes
I use Jupyter Notebook for code maintain, because is not file per file instead. but use cell per cell, so you don't need new file to make a some different Block Program. it's useful for making some Data Science and plot diagram, or maintain for organizing code per cell. it's up to you, you can install it for learn
